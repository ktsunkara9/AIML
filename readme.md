# AIML Projects

This repository contains a collection of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) projects implemented in Python. Each project demonstrates the use of various AI/ML techniques, libraries, and frameworks for solving real-world problems.

---

## Contents

- Individual project folders, each with its own code, documentation, and requirements.
- Example projects may include:
  - Chatbots
  - Text classification
  - Image recognition
  - Data preprocessing and analysis
  - Embedding and vector search
  - And more

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- See each project's `requirements.txt` for specific dependencies

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIML.git
   cd AIML
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project folder and install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd <project-folder>
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Each project contains its own instructions in a `README.md` file.
- Typical usage involves running a Python script or launching a web app (e.g., with Streamlit or Flask).
